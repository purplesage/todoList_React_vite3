
Task app implemented with react, fireBase (fireStore, auth, and storage) and vite3.
It also features a storage and notes section (handled with firebase) which i myself find pretty useful since i am so messy and
often have info all over the place. So this app helps me keep it in one place.

This is a project made as part of my web development learning path.
